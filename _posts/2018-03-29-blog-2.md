March 8 marks International Women’s Day — an annual day of recognizing the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. This year we’re celebrating by putting the spotlight on three of our female employees who have built successful careers in traditionally male-dominated fields.

Meet Jana Trojanova, Jitka Hankova, and Laura Radaelli — a powerful trio comprised of a Software Engineer, Product Lead, and Data Engineer. We sat down with the three of them and discussed their interest in technology, what fuels their drive, and how they’ll be celebrating International Women’s Day.
