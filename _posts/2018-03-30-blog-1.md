Back in 2016, when I became responsible for the Memsource Academic Edition and our partnerships with academic institutions in general, my main goal was simple. I wanted to spread the love and present the benefits of cooperating with Memsource to as many academic institutions as possible.

As the number of universities offering training in Memsource grew – and quite significantly, I must compliment myself, as it doubled from 56 to 103 in a year – the objectives began to shift. We used 2017 to better understand our clients, the professors supporting our program, and knowing how they worked with Memsource and how we could adapt the program to better suit their expectations.

I had the invaluable opportunity to peep into the mechanics of a number of different translation programs, to see how trainings were structured, and how students get to know about our tool. Thanks to that, I was able to identify what Memsource could do to further help students become prepared for the translation industry – and actually offer the professors a chance to give feedback and talk through future ideas.

The exploration resulted in both the <a href="#">Memsource Student Certification Program</a> being <a href="#">launched last September</a? and a number of smaller projects such as <a href="#">interviews with students</a>, a professor’s input on <a href="#">being successful in the industry</a>, and hosting a <a href="#">contest</a>.
