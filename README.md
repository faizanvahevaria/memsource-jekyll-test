# memsource-jekyll-test
This is a test website built using Jekyll to check if all the required functions for memsource website are achievable or not.

I will be using https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/ theme for the test website.
I will be using https://github.com/mrzool/polyglot-jekyll to make the website support multiple languages and switch in between them seamlessly.

Initially, I will be converting "About" page from the memsource website and make it available in all 4 languages to show how the pages work in multi-language setup. And the latest blog post to show how the posts work for multiple languages.
